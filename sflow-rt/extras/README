This directory contains example Python scripts demonstrating sFlow-RT's
REST API:

* tail_log.py       - tail the event log
* tail_flows.py     - tail flow log
* leafandspine.py   - create hybrid OpenFlow fabrics using Mininet
* topflows.py       - text based client displaying top flows

Note: The Python scripts make use of the Python requests library:
      http://python-requests.org/

The demo.pcap file contains captured sFlow datagrams. To run sFlow-RT using
the captured file, modify the start script as follows:

start.sh
  JVM_OPTS="-Dsflow.file=extras/demo.pcap"

start.bat
  java -Dsflow.file=extras\demo.pcap -jar lib\sflowrt.jar

The init.d directory contains a startup script that can be used to run sFlow-RT
as a daemon.
